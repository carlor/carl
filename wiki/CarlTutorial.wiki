= Hello, World! =
As always, we must start by outputting the string {{{"hello world"}}} to standard output. In Carl, this is easily accomplished:

{{{
PrintLn "hello world"
}}}

Classes of the standard library are written starting with the upper case. It is recommended that your classes start with a lower case.

= Basic Literals, Classes =
To use a class, it only has to be mentioned as descending from something else, and Carl will know it's a class. To link a child to it's parent, the {{{:}}} operator is used. {{{|}}} is the "sibling" operator - it becomes the child of the parent.

{{{
parent : U # U is the Universal Class.
bro : parent
sis | bro
# now bro and sis are children of "parent"
}}}

What's the use of the sibling operator? Check this out:

{{{
x : 4
y : x
x : 5
PrintLn y
}}}

One would expect this to print {{{4}}}. Actually, this would produce undefined behavior. This is because {{{y}}} is a grandchild of {{{4}}}, not a child. When commanding {{{y : x}}}, you make {{{y}}} a child of {{{x}}} a child of {{{4}}}. You want to make it a sibling.

Use the sibling operator when dealing with values, unless you know it should be the child operator.
