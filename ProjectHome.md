An interpreter for Carl, a programming language based off of a new concept of HOP (Hierarchy-Oriented-Programming).

I'm currently implementing it...if you're interested, I'll upload the code. I won't bother to neaten it all up if no one will read it.

The implementation I'm working on is written in D. If you want to write your own implementation, contact me, I'm a novice and you'll do better.
